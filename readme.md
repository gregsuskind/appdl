# AppDL

http://jakeasmith.github.io/appdl/

Just a tool for quickly downloading all of the *mac apps* a developer needs to get up and running. Right now this is just a quick and dirty list I compiled while bringing up a new machine. If you have an app that should be on the list please add it to the `apps.js` file and submit a pull request. Thanks to all of the app developer out there who make it possible for me to do my job on a daily basis.

# Roadmap
* Get more apps
* Make it pretty (add in app logos)
* Create some sort of downloader (copy / paste is lame)
* Build in some sort of functionality for saved profiles
* Find a way to integrate with the App Store
* Maybe someday create a small downloader app to run the installers and do some cleanup afterwards
